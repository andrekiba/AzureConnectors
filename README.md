# Azure Connectors for Azure Functions

Here the code related to the sessions I held at:

* **RoboGen 2020** https://youtu.be/TCJJpC0P-gk  
* **Scottish Summit 2021** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LCcwqHdxuI  
* **Global Power Platform Bootcamp 2021** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxKcfQry18A  

The idea of Azure Connectors is to open the possibility to use Logic Apps connectors everywhere.  
This is very useful in Azure Functions where with few line of codes we can interact with a plenty of othere services    
such as Teams, Graph, Outlook365, Azure Automation, Azure DevOps...  
without loosing time to setup authentication/authorizaion and other boring stuff.
